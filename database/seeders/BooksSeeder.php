            'NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER - Change can begin right now. Learn to bring about dynamic personal growth using five uniquely effective tools--from psychotherapist Barry Michels and psychiatrist Phil Stutz, subject of the Netflix documentary Stutz, directed by Jonah Hill.

            "These tools are emotional game changers. They do nothing less than deliver you to your best and most powerful self."--Kathy Freston, author of Quantum Wellness

            The Tools offers a solution to the biggest complaint patients have about therapy: the interminable wait for change to begin. The traditional therapeutic model sets its sights on the past, but psychiatrist Phil Stutz and psychotherapist Barry Michels employ an arsenal of techniques--"the tools"--that allow patients to use their problems as levers that access the power of the unconscious and propel them into action. Suddenly, through this transformative approach, obstacles become new chances--to find courage, embrace discipline, develop self-expression, deepen creativity.

            A dynamic, results-oriented practice, The Tools aims to deliver relief from persistent problems and restore control and hope right away. Every day presents challenges--big and small--that the tools transform into opportunities to bring about bold and dramatic change in your life. Stutz and Michels teach you how to:

            - Get Unstuck Master the things you are avoiding and live in forward motion.
            - Control Anger Free yourself from out-of-control rage and never-ending grudges.
            - Express Yourself Learn the secret of true confidence and find your authentic voice.
            - Combat Anxiety Stop obsessive worrying and negative thinking.
            - Find Discipline Activate willpower and make the most of every minute.

            With The Tools, Stutz and Michels allow you to realize the full range of your potential. Their goal is nothing less than for your life to become exceptional--exceptional in its resiliency, in its experience of real happiness, and in its understanding of the human spirit.',

            'The four vital tools in Coming Alive help you connect to the Life Force--a wellspring of positive energy that is the source of creativity, renewal, confidence, and engagement--and harness the energy and will to combat Part X. Drawing insights from their decades of psychotherapeutic practice, their lived experience, and their moving and generous understanding of our interconnectedness, Michels and Stutz have created a paradigm-shifting guide to achieving optimal mental health and spiritual well-being.',

            'THE PHENOMENAL INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER: 1 MILLION COPIES SOLD

            Transform your life with tiny changes in behaviour, starting now.

            People think that when you want to change your life, you need to think big. But world-renowned habits expert James Clear has discovered another way. He knows that real change comes from the compound effect of hundreds of small decisions: doing two push-ups a day, waking up five minutes early, or holding a single short phone call.

            He calls them atomic habits.

            In this ground-breaking book, Clears reveals exactly how these minuscule changes can grow into such life-altering outcomes. He uncovers a handful of simple life hacks (the forgotten art of Habit Stacking, the unexpected power of the Two Minute Rule, or the trick to entering the Goldilocks Zone), and delves into cutting-edge psychology and neuroscience to explain why they matter. Along the way, he tells inspiring stories of Olympic gold medalists, leading CEOs, and distinguished scientists who have used the science of tiny habits to stay productive, motivated, and happy.

            These small changes will have a revolutionary effect on your career, your relationships, and your life.',

            Bella will soon discover that there is a very good reason for Edwards coldness. He, and his family, are vampires - and he knows how dangerous it is for others to get too close.',
